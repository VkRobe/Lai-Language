The goal of this project is primarily to make a working compiler that takes an input language and compiles to C or C++ (undecided as of yet). 
The general design of the language will be "C++ without the BS" which is most definitely over ambitious, but it's nice to set high goals.
Heavy inspiration taken from Johnathan Blow's Jai (that much is probably obvious).

Once I have a more clear definition of the language it will go here, but for now I will put some code samples that 
demonstrate the syntax I have in mind. They can be found in /lai-compiler-v4/tests.
